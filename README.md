This extension adds Wren language support for Visual Studio Code. Install it by hitting `Ctrl + P` and entering

```
ext install vscode-wren
```

* snippets for base language features, such as control flow and import statements
* snippets for core library (currently only consisting of `System`)

## Roadmap

While Wren is still changing, a [static analyzer](https://github.com/munificent/wrenalyzer) is already under development. In the future, I want to integrate such a tool into this extension in order to implement autocomplete and error checking.
